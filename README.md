Social Media is a global phenomenon that has permanently changed the way we communicate and interact with each other. The rise of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. has revolutionized how we share our thoughts and opinions with one another. The world has become smaller than ever before as we are now able to connect with people across different countries in mere seconds.

However, despite all its benefits, there are some inherent problems with social media platforms which prevent them from being used to their full potential. Some of these problems include:

Insecure Data Storage: Social media platforms store all your personal data on their servers which makes it vulnerable to hackers and other cyber criminals who can easily steal your data and use it for malicious purposes such as identity theft or credit card fraud etc.;

Lack Of Transparency: Most social media websites have no clear policies regarding how they collect your data or how long they keep it for which makes it difficult for users to understand what is going on behind the scenes of their favorite platform;

Poor User Experience: Most social media websites use an outdated interface which makes it difficult for users to find information on them easily;

Social Media is a web application built on blockchain technology. It provides a secure, decentralized, and private way for users to share content with each other.

The vision of SocialMedia is to be the first digital currency based social media application in the world that can be used by everyone, from individuals to businesses and organizations, without limitation or restrictions.

SocialMedia aims to improve our current social media system by integrating blockchain technology into it so that users can enjoy more benefits from using our app than what they currently experience today on other platforms such as Facebook, Twitter etc...
Smart Social Media is a next-generation social media platform built on blockchain technology. It is a decentralized, secure and transparent social media ecosystem that enables users to monetize their personal data and content as well as incentivize other users for sharing relevant information.

The Smart Social Media platform consists of three different layers:

1) Personal data layer (storage and protection) — This layer is where all user data will be stored and secured through blockchain encryption. The user will have full ownership over their personal data, including photos, videos, comments, likes and much more. Users will be able to monetize their personal data by selling it directly to advertisers or any third party interested in purchasing it.

2) Content layer (creation & distribution) — This layer is where all content will be created and distributed through the Smart Social Media platform. Users can create content such as text posts or images/videos which are then stored on the network for free for anyone else to use or view at anytime. If someone wants to access your content they must pay you directly using SMT tokens or their own SMT token balance. The creator of the content also receives an amount of SMT tokens based on how many times they were viewed by others in the network during that day

3) Application layer
